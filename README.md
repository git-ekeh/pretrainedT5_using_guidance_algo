# pretrainedT5_using_guidance_algo

Trained T5 on an annotated XSUM summarization dataset. 
The dataset consisted of a "document" feature, a "summary" feature, and a "guidance" feature. 
The results are within the notebook.
I used TensorBoard to track metrics, and HuggingFace's training platform to run the experiment.
